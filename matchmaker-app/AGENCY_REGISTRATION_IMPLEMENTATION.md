# Agency Registration Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive multi-step agency registration form for the matchmaker app. This implementation follows the same pattern as the existing helper registration but is specifically tailored for employment agencies.

  - Whether replacement helpers are provided
  - Number of replacements offered
  - Guarantee period

### 5. Agency Photos
- **Profile Photo** - 1 photo (logo, office front, team photo)
- **Business Photos** - Up to 5 photos (office interior, certificates, staff, etc.)
- Comprehensive photo guidelines and benefits explanation
- Same upload system as helper photos (Firebase + Supabase)

## Technical Implementation

### Components Created

1. **`MultiStepAgencyRegistration.jsx`** - Main wrapper component
2. **`AgencyBasicInfoStep.jsx`** - Step 1: Basic business information
3. **`AgencyLicenseStep.jsx`** - Step 2: License and regulatory info
4. **`AgencyServicesStep.jsx`** - Step 3: Services and geographic coverage
5. **`AgencyFeesStep.jsx`** - Step 4: Fees and policies
6. **`AgencyPhotosStep.jsx`** - Step 5: Photo uploads

### Integration Points

- **Registration Page**: Updated `/src/app/registration/[userType]/page.jsx` to use the new agency registration form when `userType === 'agency'`
- **Photo Upload**: Extended existing photo upload system to support agency photo types
- **Data Storage**: Agency data is stored in Firebase with the same structure as other user types
- **Validation**: Comprehensive client-side validation for all required fields

### Data Structure

The agency registration captures data in the following structure:

```javascript
{
  // Basic Information
  businessName: string,
  uenNumber: string,
  contactNumber: string,
  email: string,
  businessAddress: string,
  website: string,
  businessDescription: string,
  yearsInBusiness: string,
  
  // License Information
  eaLicenseNumber: string,
  licenseExpiryDate: string,
  keyPersonnel: string,
  additionalCertifications: array,
  otherLicenses: string,
  complianceDeclaration: object,
  
  // Services
  servicesProvided: array,
  countriesOfHelpers: array,
  specializations: array,
  additionalServices: array,
  serviceDescription: string,
  
  // Fees & Policies
  agencyFee: {
    currency: string,
    minAmount: number,
    maxAmount: number,
    structure: string,
    details: string
  },
  providesReplacement: string,
  replacementCount: string,
  replacementPeriod: string,
  replacementConditions: string,
  paymentTerms: array,
  additionalPolicies: string,
  
  // Photos
  profilePhoto: array,
  businessPhotos: array,
  
  // Enhanced metadata
  agencyProfile: object,
  profileCompleteness: number,
  registrationCompletedAt: string
}
```

### Enhanced Agency Profile

The system generates an `agencyProfile` object with computed metrics:

- Service capabilities (agency hire, direct hire, replacement service)
- Geographic reach analysis (Southeast Asia, East Asia, South Asia)
- Fee structure analysis
- Profile completeness metrics
- Contact method availability

## Photo Upload System

### Supabase Storage Integration

- **Profile photos**: Stored in `profile-images` bucket under `userId/agency-profile-photos/`
- **Business photos**: Stored in `profile-images` bucket under `userId/agency-business-photos/`
- **Metadata**: Stored in Firebase `user_photos` collection
- **API Route**: Uses existing `/api/upload-photo` endpoint

### Photo Guidelines

Comprehensive guidelines provided for:
- Profile photo best practices (logo, office exterior, team photos)
- Business photo ideas (interior, certificates, staff, events)
- Technical requirements (formats, file size, resolution)
- Benefits explanation (trust building, competitive advantage)

## Form Validation

### Required Fields
- Business name, UEN number, contact number, email, business address
- EA license number
- At least one service type (Agency Hire or Direct Hire)
- At least one country for helper recruitment
- Agency fee structure (currency and fee range)
- Replacement policy specification

### Optional Fields
- All other fields are optional but encouraged for better profile completeness

## User Experience Features

### Multi-Step Navigation
- 5-step wizard with progress indicator
- Step validation with error highlighting
- Ability to navigate between steps
- Skip functionality disabled (all steps should be completed)

### Visual Design
- Consistent with existing helper registration design
- Color-coded sections (blue for basic info, yellow for licenses, green for services, etc.)
- Informational boxes explaining requirements and benefits
- Summary sections showing selected options

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-friendly layout
- Grid layouts that adapt to screen size
- Touch-friendly form controls

## Testing and Quality Assurance

### Code Quality
- TypeScript-ready JSX components
- Consistent naming conventions
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper state management

### Build Verification
- Components compile successfully with Next.js
- No syntax errors or import issues
- Proper integration with existing codebase

## Usage

After implementation, agencies can register by:

1. Signing up as an "Agency" user type
2. Completing the 5-step registration process:
   - Basic business information
   - License and compliance details
   - Services and geographic coverage
   - Fee structure and policies
   - Photo uploads (optional but recommended)
3. Submitting the form to complete registration
4. Being redirected to the dashboard

## Benefits for the Platform

## Conclusion

It captures all necessary information for effective matching while ensuring compliance with Singapore's employment agency regulations. The implementation follows existing patterns in the codebase and integrates seamlessly with the current infrastructure.
