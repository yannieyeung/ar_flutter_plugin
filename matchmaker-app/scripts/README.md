# Database Seeding Scripts

This directory contains scripts for seeding your matchmaker app database with sample data.

## Helper Seeding Script

### Overview
The `seedHelpers.js` script generates 10 realistic helper profiles with comprehensive data including:

- **Personal Information**: Name, date of birth, nationality, contact details
- **Experience & Skills**: Work history, relevant skills, specializations  
- **Medical Information**: Health conditions, allergies, dietary preferences
- **Work Preferences**: Availability, preferred family size, location preferences
- **ML Profile**: Skills vectors and personality traits for AI matching
- **Registration Status**: Complete profiles ready for matching

### Prerequisites

1. **Firebase Setup**: Ensure your Firebase Admin SDK is properly configured
2. **Environment Variables**: Set up your Firebase credentials in `.env.local` (see Firebase Admin setup)
3. **Dependencies**: The script requires the `uuid` and `dotenv` packages (already installed)

### Usage

#### Method 1: Direct Execution
```bash
# From the matchmaker-app directory
node scripts/seedHelpers.js
```

#### Method 2: Using npm script (recommended)
Add to your `package.json` scripts section:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "seed:helpers": "node scripts/seedHelpers.js"
  }
}
```

Then run:
```bash
npm run seed:helpers
```

### Firebase Admin Configuration

The script automatically loads Firebase credentials from your `.env.local` file. You need these environment variables:

#### Required Environment Variables in `.env.local`
```bash
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=your-service-account-email@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYour private key here\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
```

#### Getting Firebase Credentials
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Project Settings â†’ Service Accounts
2. Click "Generate new private key"
3. Download the JSON file
4. Extract the values and add them to your `.env.local` file

**Note**: The private key should include the `\n` characters for line breaks, and the entire key should be wrapped in quotes.

### Generated Data

Each helper profile includes:

**Personal Details:**
- Full name (culturally appropriate for nationality)
- Date of birth (age 21-50)
- Nationality from 10 Southeast Asian countries
- Contact information and addresses
- Physical characteristics and family details

**Professional Information:**
- 0-15 years of experience
- 3-8 relevant skills from a comprehensive list
- Detailed work history with responsibilities
- Specializations and certifications

**Health & Preferences:**
- Medical history and allergies (realistic distribution)
- Dietary restrictions and food handling preferences
- Work schedule and location preferences
- Interview availability and readiness status

**AI Matching Data:**
- Skills vectors for machine learning
- Experience level categorization
- Personality traits and work preferences
- Compatibility scoring data

### Sample Output

```
ðŸŒ± Starting to seed helpers data...
âœ… Generated helper 1: Maria Santos from Philippines
âœ… Generated helper 2: Sari Dewi from Indonesia
âœ… Generated helper 3: Thida Aung from Myanmar
...

ðŸŽ‰ Successfully seeded 10 helpers to the database!

ðŸ“‹ Summary of created helpers:
1. Maria Santos (Philippines) - 5 years experience
2. Sari Dewi (Indonesia) - 0 years experience
3. Thida Aung (Myanmar) - 12 years experience
...

ðŸ’¡ You can now view these helpers in your app dashboard.
```

### Database Structure

Helpers are stored in the `users` collection with:
- Document ID: Generated UUID
- UserType: `individual_helper`
- All profile fields as defined in your registration forms
- Timestamps for creation and updates
- ML profile data for AI matching

### Troubleshooting

**Authentication Errors:**
- Verify Firebase credentials are properly configured
- Check that your service account has Firestore write permissions
- Ensure the Firebase project ID is correct

**Permission Errors:**
- Verify your Firebase rules allow writes to the `users` collection
- Check that the service account has the necessary IAM roles

**Module Not Found:**
- Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- Verify you're running the script from the correct directory

### Customization

You can modify the script to:
- Change the number of helpers generated (modify the loop in `seedHelpers()`)
- Add additional countries or cities to the sample data
- Adjust the probability distributions for various attributes
- Include additional fields specific to your app's requirements

### Security Notes

- Never commit service account keys to version control
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Consider using Firebase Admin SDK with minimal required permissions
- The generated email addresses use `@example.com` domain to avoid conflicts
