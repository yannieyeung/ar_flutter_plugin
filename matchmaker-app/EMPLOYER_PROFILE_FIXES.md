# Employer Profile Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Profile Picture Not Showing ✅
**Problem**: The profile page was looking for photos with `photoType === 'profile-pictures'` but the employer registration form uploads with `uploadPath="employer-profiles"`.

**Solution**: Updated the profile picture display logic to check for both photo types:
```javascript
// Before
allPhotos.filter(photo => photo.photoType === 'profile-pictures')

// After  
allPhotos.filter(photo => photo.photoType === 'employer-profiles' || photo.photoType === 'profile-pictures')
```

### 2. Removed Completion Percentage ✅
**Problem**: The profile completion percentage was not useful at the moment.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the progress bar and completion percentage display from the profile page
- Removed the `getCompletionPercentage()` function
- Removed the `calculateProfileCompleteness()` function from the registration form
- Removed `profileCompleteness` field from the registration data

### 3. Updated Profile Fields to Match Registration Form ✅
**Problem**: The profile page showed company fields (companyName, companySize, industry) and contactNumber which aren't asked in the registration form.

**Solution**: Completely redesigned the employer profile sections to match the registration form:

#### New Profile Structure:

**EmployerPersonalInfo Section:**
- Full Name (editable)
- Email Address (editable) 
- Location (editable)
- Self Introduction (editable)

**EmployerHouseholdInfo Section:**
- Household Size (dropdown, editable)
- Children at Home (checkbox, editable)
- Number of Children (conditional, editable)
- Children's Ages (conditional, editable)
- Pets at Home (checkbox, editable)
- Pet Details (conditional, editable)

**EmployerPreferences Section:**
- Preferred Languages (multi-select checkboxes, editable)
- Specific Requirements (textarea, editable)

#### Data Structure Updates:

**Removed Fields:**
- `contactNumber`
- `residentialAddress` 
- `description`
- `companyName`
- `companySize`
- `industry`

**Added Fields:**
- `email`
- `householdSize`
- `hasKids`
- `numberOfKids`
- `kidsAges`
- `hasPets`
- `petDetails`
- `selfIntroduction`
- `preferredLanguages`
- `specificRequirements`
